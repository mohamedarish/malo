firefox extension that gets the meaning for manglish words

## Updates

- 16/9 First push.
- 17/9 Made making the algorithm a streamlined process and thought of a way to do it.
- 17/9 Update 2: Made significant updates to the convertor function.
- 18/9 Why don't browsers just choose to support typescript instead of javascript? It's better in every way. compiling javascripts give stupid errors like top-level imports only even though the import is at the first line.
- 18/9 Update 2: It now works but We need to manually add .js to all import statement filenames as tsc doesn't have a functiuonality to do it on it's own and throws an error if i use a .ts in my typescript imports.
